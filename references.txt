1) The steepest descent method is surprisingly a less effective method for global minima search....and the implementation of heuristics like momentum and delta-bar-delta procedures can significantly improve the rate of convergence.

2) Using dedicated hardware to do machine learning
typically ends up in disaster because of cost,
obsolescence, and poor software. Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which are now
available on every PC, provides an attractive
alternative which yield speedup in both training and testing in Machine Learning algorithms.
